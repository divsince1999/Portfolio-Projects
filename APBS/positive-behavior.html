                                            <p>In the past, intervention strategies were designed to decrease problem
                                                behavior without considering how these interventions might affect other
                                                areas of an individual’s life. A single intervention, implemented to
                                                reduce problem behavior, often resulted in narrowly focused behavior
                                                support plans. The effectiveness of today’s behavior support plan is
                                                judged by different standards. Positive behavior support (PBS)
                                                strategies are considered effective when interventions result in
                                                increases in an individual’s success and personal satisfaction, and the
                                                enhancement of positive social interactions across work, academic,
                                                recreational, and community settings. Valued outcomes include increases
                                                in quality of life as defined by an individual’s unique preferences and
                                                needs and positive lifestyle changes that increase social belonging.</p>

                                            <p>Positive behavior support is based upon behavioral and biomedical
                                                science. Research in applied behavior analysis has demonstrated the
                                                importance of analyzing the interaction between behavior and the
                                                environment. From this perspective, behavior is considered purposeful
                                                and is under the control of environmental factors that can be changed.

                                                based upon research in applied behavior analysis and emphasize the
                                                importance of implementing intervention strategies that are effective in
                                                natural everyday settings.</p>

                                                based on biomedical science. In the past, behavioral and psychiatric
                                                interventions have often been managed separately with very little
                                                collaboration between behavior consultants and medical personnel.
                                                Information related to an individual’s psychiatric state and the
                                                knowledge of other biological factors can assist professionals in
                                                understanding the interaction between the physiological and
                                                environmental factors that influence behavior.</p>

                                                designs are very effective when studying a small number of variables
                                                that influence a person’s behavior. However, professionals often

                                                in complex and ever-changing systems. As a result, a number of different
                                                research strategies are needed to evaluate a behavior support plan’s
                                                success. These strategies move beyond single subject experiments that
                                                isolate one variable while holding all others constant. Positive
                                                behavior support professionals implement system-level interventions to
                                                ensure the success of multiple interventions while working within
                                                everyday settings. Data collected to evaluate positive behavior support
                                                outcomes can include program evaluation measures, qualitative research,
                                                surveys, rating scales, interviews, correlational analyses, direct
                                                observation, and self-report information.</p>

                            <p>Positive behavior support is a community based approach that involves learning more about the environment in which a child or adult lives, and working collaboratively with everyone in that setting to design strategies for promoting positive social and communication skills. Preventing problem behavior becomes the focus of planning for larger groups so that all children and adults within a setting are interacting in positive and meaningful ways.</p>
                            <p>The triangle below provides a way to think about systems change in positive behavior support. A systems-wide approach to positive behavior support means that strategies for teaching social and communication skills and for reinforcing those skills are established so that all of the children or adults within a setting are receiving support in a preventative manner. In addition, plans are made to make sure everyone is consistent when responding to the occurrence of problem behavior. Strategies that address all children within a school, or all of the adults in a community setting are referred to as Primary Prevention strategies.</p>
                            <p>However, some children or adults may need additional support to be successful. Creating strategies for the early identification of children and adults in need of additional support is a critical part of positive behavior support. Intervening early and providing extra individualized or targeted group instruction in social and communication skills and changing the environment in ways that prevent problem behavior is an important part of Secondary Prevention strategies. Finally, a more comprehensive and individualized positive behavior support plan may be needed to ensure a child or adult receives that support needed to be successful and happy and to decrease the occurrence of problem behavior. These strategies are referred to as Tertiary Prevention.</p>
                            <p>Although positive behavior support implementation may look different in early childhood settings, in public schools, or working with adults with disabilities, the systems and processes are similar.</p>
