                            <p>The Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions aims to expand the knowledge and practice
                                of effective behavioral support in school, home, and community settings, focusing on
                                comprehensive outcomes for children, youth, and adults. The goal is to extend the
                                empirical database; enhance the conceptual framework; and provide a forum for
                                researchers, professionals, families, and policymakers. Articles are relevant for the
                                development and application of behavioral support and offer sound, research-based
                                principles of positive behavior support for use in school, home, and community settings
                                with people with challenges in behavioral adaptation. Regular features include empirical
                                research; discussion, literature reviews, and conceptual papers; programs, practices,
                                and innovations; forums; and media reviews. Published by the Hammill Institute on

                        <p>The Association for Positive Behavior Supports (APBS) Board of Directors adopted the initial
                            Positive Behavior Support Standards of Practice: Individual Level in March 2007. Over the
                            years, the practices associated with positive behavior support have evolved as our field
                            improves on how to best serve and improve the quality of life for individuals, as evidenced
                            by the APBS Mission, Vision, and Equity Statement. To address the diverse needs of the APBS
                            membership and field, a multidisciplinary team of 15 members from two countries met over a
                            year (March 2022-March 2023). In March of 2023, APBS officially endorsed the 2023 Practice
                            Guidelines , which serve as a broad set of guidelines designed to be applied across various
                            settings (school, home, community) and with diverse populations.</p>
                        <p>These practice guidelines are intended to apply across the breadth and depth of positive
                            behavior support. These practice guidelines serve as “guideposts,” reflecting the values of
                            what APBS believes is critical to the practice of positive behavior support. To streamline
                            language while at the same time valuing the range of disciplines within positive behavior
                            support, the committee identified the following terms to represent the breadth of
                            application within this field: Collaborator groups: this term includes, but is not limited
                            to, individuals, families, community members, agencies, and school personnel.</p>
