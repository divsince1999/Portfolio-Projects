                                promoting positive behavior in school districts to empower your team to create a safe

                            <p>We like to think of the APBS community as a network of multidisciplinary peers coming
                                together to advance knowledge, share resources, and advance positive behavior support.
                                We’ve been working hard to develop new ways to unite our diverse community. During this
                                main stage, Sanfelippo will share their successes, explain the importance of Tier 1
                                interventions, encourage equity in the use of behavior-specific praise, and promote
                                well-being through relationship building. Come to this keynote to find out exactly

                            <p>On day two, we’re keeping the momentum by bringing out a heavy hitter, Lola Dada-Olley.
                                Lola touches on societal stigma, culture, the intersection of race and disability, and
                                corporate disability inclusion efforts. She will share that getting a diagnosis for
                                autism—or for any special need—is like being “drafted into the special forces unit of
                                motherhood.” And for her, that has happened twice.</p>
                            <p>Dada-Olley’s multi-generational experience with autism gives her a unique perspective and
                                a passion for " living out loud.” Lola will help conference attendees improve their
                                understanding of the support families and the IDD community need while providing a
                                framework for professionals to better support families with children with disabilities.
