              <p>Associations like APBS are built on a system of committee actions, linking the association with the attitudes, expectations, and needs in the real world of its members. Committees represent, involve, and serve members. They also provide an important training ground for future leaders. Committees are an effective workforce for the association – they ensure group participation in problem-solving and provide a critical forum for the many interests within the association.</p>
              <p>Effective committees unify, represent, motivate, coordinate, consolidate and communicate. They function best when their members are selected appropriately, and they have a clearly defined mission, strong leadership, and support from APBS administration.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of APBS members volunteer their time and expertise by serving on committees and workgroups that work on behalf of the APBS Board of Directors to strengthen the positive behavior support community.</p>
              <p>The APBS President works with volunteer and staff leaders to develop priorities and work plans that align with the strategic plan and support upcoming initiatives and to appoint chairs, and recruit people with a wide range of perspectives. All committees and task forces provide reports to the Board quarterly.</p>
